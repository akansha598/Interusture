# Interusture
Gesture recognition using MediaPipe typically leverages its Hand Tracking or Pose Estimation solutions. The hand tracking model detects and tracks hand landmarks in real time, providing a set of 21 3D landmarks for each hand. These landmarks can then be used to identify specific gestures, such as thumbs-up, waving, or custom gestures, by analyzing the positions and movements of the hand.
